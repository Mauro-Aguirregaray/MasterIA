Grid: 0.5° x 0.5°  

Spatial area: 25W - 40E und 30 - 70N

Note: the date are valied for a 0.5x0.5deg box. The center of the box is
always on a xx.25 coordinate	

Time period: Winter 1500 - Autumn 2002 

YearSeason followed by 9100 Gridpoints
Seasons are given as  13(Winter, DJF), 14(Spring, MAM), 15 (Summer, JJA), 16 (Autumn, SON)

Therefore, each row consist of year Season and a long string 
with 9100 gridpoints

Meaning, for each Season all gridpoints on the same latutide,
one after the other, starting in the NW, ending in the SE.

There are 130 longitudes and 70 latitudes

1st gridpoint  : 70N/25W (centered on: 69.75/24.75W)
2nd gridpoint  : 70N/24.5W (centered on: 69.75/24.25W) 
3rd gridpoint  : 70N/24W (centered on: 69.75/23.75W)
130th gridpoint: 70N/40E (centered on: 69.75/39.75E)
131th gridpoint: 69.5N/25W (centered on: 69.25/24.75W)
...
...
9100th gridpoint (last one): 35N/40E (centered on: 35.25/39.75E)

Note, only values over land, values over water are set to NA
 All the seasonly surface air temperature data from Winter 1500 to Autumn 1900
are reconstructions (Luterbacher et al. 2004, Xoplaki et al. 2005),
data from 1901-2002 stem from Mitchell et al. (2004),
Climatic Research Unit.
Note that the reconstructions from 1500-1900 are entirely based on temperature related predictors and do
not include station pressure series.
